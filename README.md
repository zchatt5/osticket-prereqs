This tutorial outlines the prerequisites and installation of the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket. The project demonstrates the osTticket help desk system in a cloud-hosted enviornment by using Microsoft Azure.<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Internet Information Services (IIS)
- osTicket

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 11 for Desktop
- Windows 10 for Virtual Machine</b> (22H2)

<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

- Azure Subscription
- Azure Virtual Machine
    - OS: Windows 10
    - vCPUs: 4
- Remote Desktop Connection
  
<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

### Step 1: Create and Configure the Azure Virtual Machine
<p>

</p>
<p>
Logged into Azure to start creating my enviornment for osTicket. Created a Resource Group called "osTicket" for where the Virtual Machine and Virtual Network will be located.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
After creating the resource group I needed to create a virtual network for my setup on the Virtual Machine. I called the network "ticket-vnet" and put it into the resource group.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Creating a Virtual Machine called "ost-vm". Using the resource group made before (osTicket) and put it there. I'm also using "West US 2" as my region because that is closest to me for quicker feedback, but can be done in a different Region. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
For the Image/OS I used Windows 10 Enterprise, version 22H2 - x64 Gen2. For Size I used Standard L2s v4 (2 vcpus, 16 GiB memory).

<p>

</p>
<p>
For logging into the Virtual Machine you need a Username and Password. 
    
    - Username: labuser
    - Password: Cyberlab123!

Since I'm using a Windows 10/11 OS I need to check the licensing at the bottom. The usernames and passwords I use are for this project only. Its never good to store your passwords in plain text.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Went to the Networking tab and verified that my Virtual Network is selected to "ticket-vnet". Then I went to the Review + Create tab to finish my Virtual Machine. 
</p>

### Step 2: Getting osTicket Files and Dependicies
<p>
<img width="976" height="566" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b86befaf-0299-4309-8bf6-23841941cb09" />
</p>
<p>
Go to the windows search bar to open up "Remote Desktop Connection". Copy + Paste the public IP address of the virtual machine to connect. Enter the username and password used during the setup process. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Inside the VM download the required osTicket Installation Files and saved them locally to the desktop. Extracted the contents of the file named "osTicket-Installation-Files". 
</p>
<br />

### Step 3: Install and Enable IIS with CGI. (Web Server)

</p>
<p>
To Enable go to the start menu and open the control panel. Then click on programs -> Programs and Features -> Turn Windows features on or off.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Enable Internet Information Services. Go to Internet Information Services -> World Wide Web Services -> Application Development Features -> Enable CGI.
